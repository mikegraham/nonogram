Puzzle description
##################

Nonograms are a category of logic puzzles. A nonogram can be described
as an encoded picture. The only hints are sequences of numbers printed
alongside rows and columns.

Each number in a sequence means a sequence of consecutive colored squares.
For example -  **3, 5, 7** means a sequence of *exactly* 3 colored squares,
then 5 colored squares, and 7 colored squares.

Solving nonograms is a topic for an entire article, but two simple hints should
get anyone going:

  * start from big numbers
  * marking empty squares is just as important as marking colored ones
